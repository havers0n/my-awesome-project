# Lingering Issues and Proposed Solutions

This document outlines the remaining issues identified after the initial testing phase, along with proposed solutions and workarounds.

### High Priority

*   **Security Risk: Hardcoded Credentials**
    *   **Problem:** Several test files (`test_with_token.js`, `test-forecast-api.ps1`, and `test_api.ps1`) contain hardcoded user credentials and JWT tokens. This is a significant security risk.
    *   **Solution:** Remove the hardcoded credentials from the test files. Use environment variables or a secure secret management system to handle sensitive information. For testing, use a separate, non-production environment with dedicated test users and credentials.

### Medium Priority

*   **Incomplete User Management**
    *   **Problem:** The system lacks functionality for deleting and updating user information, as noted in `SUPABASE_SYNC.md`.
    *   **Solution:** Implement the necessary API endpoints and database logic to support user deletion and updates. Ensure that these actions are properly synchronized between Supabase and the local PostgreSQL database.

*   **Missing Email Uniqueness Check**
    *   **Problem:** There is no validation to prevent multiple users from registering with the same email address.
    *   **Solution:** Implement a uniqueness check for the email field at both the database level (as a unique constraint) and in the application logic.

### Low Priority

*   **Manual UI Testing**
    *   **Problem:** The `test-forecast-ui.ps1` script requires manual authorization through the UI, making the test process inefficient.
    *   **Solution:** Automate the UI testing process. This can be achieved by using a testing framework like Cypress or Playwright to simulate user interactions, including the login process.

*   **Empty Log Directory**
    *   **Problem:** The `logs/` directory is empty, which may indicate that logging is not working as expected or that the system has not been thoroughly tested.
    *   **Solution:** Verify that the logging configuration is correct and that the application is logging important events, especially errors. If logging is working, the empty directory may indicate a lack of comprehensive testing. In this case, it's recommended to develop a more thorough testing strategy to ensure all critical paths are exercised.
