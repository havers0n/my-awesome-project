# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature addresses the 404 errors occurring when the frontend attempts to access specific API endpoints. Currently, the system is experiencing issues with two endpoints: `/api/inventory/products` and `/api/forecast/metrics`. These endpoints are critical for displaying product data and forecast metrics in the user interface. This feature will ensure these endpoints are properly implemented and accessible.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Fix Inventory Products Endpoint

**User Story:** As a user, I want to see a list of products in the dropdown menu, so that I can select a product to view its details.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/inventory/products` THEN the system SHALL return a list of all available products from the database.
2. WHEN the products endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL handle authentication correctly without blocking legitimate requests.
3. WHEN no products exist in the database THEN the system SHALL return an empty array instead of an error.
4. WHEN the products endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL return data in a consistent format with at least id and name properties for each product.
5. WHEN an error occurs during data retrieval THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message and status code.

### Requirement 2: Implement Forecast Metrics Endpoint

**User Story:** As a user, I want to access forecast metrics data, so that I can analyze performance predictions for products.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a GET request is made to `/api/forecast/metrics` THEN the system SHALL return forecast metrics data.
2. WHEN a product filter is provided THEN the system SHALL return metrics specific to that product.
3. WHEN no product filter is provided THEN the system SHALL return aggregated metrics across all products.
4. WHEN the forecast metrics endpoint is called THEN the system SHALL handle authentication correctly.
5. WHEN an error occurs during metrics retrieval THEN the system SHALL return an appropriate error message and status code.

### Requirement 3: Frontend Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want the frontend to correctly display product data and forecast metrics, so that I can make informed decisions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend loads THEN the system SHALL correctly fetch data from the API endpoints.
2. WHEN product data is successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL populate the product dropdown with the returned items.
3. WHEN forecast metrics are successfully retrieved THEN the system SHALL display them in the appropriate UI components.
4. WHEN API requests fail THEN the system SHALL display user-friendly error messages.
5. WHEN the frontend makes API requests THEN the system SHALL include proper authentication tokens.
